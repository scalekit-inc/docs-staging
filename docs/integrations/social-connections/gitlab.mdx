<Subtitle>Easily add Gitlab Sign In to your app with Scalekit</Subtitle>

## Overview

Scalekit enables apps to easily let users sign in using Gitlab as their social connector. This guide walks you through
the process of setting up the connection between Scalekit and Gitlab, and using the Scalekit SDK to add "Sign in with
Gitlab" to your application.

By the end of this guide, you will be able to:

1. Set up an OAuth 2.0 connection between Scalekit and Gitlab
2. Scalekit SDK to add "Sign in with Gitlab" to your application

## Configure OAuth settings

The OAuth Configuration details page helps you set up the connection:

- Note the **Redirect URI** provided for your app. You'll use this URL to register with Gitlab.
- **Client ID** and **Client Secret** are generated by Gitlab when you register an OAuth App. They enable Scalekit to
  authenticate your app and establish trust with Gitlab.

**Set up Gitlab OAuth 2.0**

Gitlab lets you set up OAuth through the Mircosoft Identity Platform.
[Follow Gitlab's instructions to set up OAuth 2.0](https://docs.gitlab.co.jp/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html).

- Use the Redirect URI from Scalekit as the Redirect URI in Gitlab's setup
- Copy the generated Client ID and Client Secret into the Scalekit Dashboard

After completing the setup, click "Save Changes" in Scalekit for the changes to take effect.

A summary table will show the information that will be sent to your app.
