By the end of this guide, you will be able to:

- Set up an OAuth 2.0 connection between Scalekit and Google
- Use the Scalekit SDK to add "Sign in with Google" to your application

## Setting Up Your Google Cloud Project

From the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a new project or open an existing one. Navigate to **APIs and Services** from the left sidebar, then select **Credentials** from the submenu.

</figure>

1. Choose **OAuth Client ID**. (If first time setting up OAuth, you will be prompted to set up the OAuth consent screen.)
2. Click **Configure Consent Screen** when prompted. Once configured, you will see the OAuth Client steps.
3. Select **External** as the user type for applications intended for users outside your organization.
4. Click **Next** to proceed.

### Setting Up the Consent Screen

A form will appear to collect information about your app.

Follow these steps:

1. In the **Scopes** section:

   - Add the <SimpleCode>userinfo.email</SimpleCode> and <SimpleCode>userinfo.profile</SimpleCode> scopes.
   - Select these items in the modal that appears on the right.
   - Click **Update** to save your selections.

2. Add **Test Users**:

   - Enter Google email addresses for testing purposes.
   - Click **Next** to continue.

3. Review the consent screen summary:
   - Verify all details that will be shown to users.
   - Ensure the information accurately represents your app.

1. Return to the **Credentials** page.
2. Click **Create Credentials > OAuth Client ID**.
3. Select **Web Application** from the **Application type** dropdown.

### Finalizing Setup

Name your application with a clear, descriptive title. For the **Authorized redirect URIs** field, you'll need to use a specific URL that Scalekit provides. You can find this crucial URI in the [Connect Google with Scalekit](#connect-google-with-scalekit) section below, where you'll learn how to properly set it up in the Google Console.

The instructions above are a summary of Google's instructions to set up OAuth 2.0 through Scalekit. Please [refer to Google's instructions to set up OAuth 2.0](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849) for comprehensive details.

## Connect Google with Scalekit

### Adding a Google as a Social Connection

1. Log in to your Scalekit dashboard.
2. Select **Social Login** from the left sidebar menu.
3. Click the **+ Add Connection** button.
4. Choose **Google** from the list of available providers.

The OAuth Configuration details page helps you set up the connection:

- Note the **Redirect URI** provided for your app. You'll use this URL to register with Google.
- **Client ID** and **Client Secret** are generated by Google when you register an OAuth App. They enable Scalekit to
  authenticate your app and establish trust with Google.

**Set up Google OAuth 2.0**

Google lets you set up OAuth through the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

- Use the **Redirect URI** from Scalekit as the **Callback URL** in Google's setup
- Copy the generated **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into the Scalekit Dashboard

After completing the setup, click **Save Changes** in Scalekit for the changes to take effect.

## Next steps

After successfully configuring the Google connection, consult our [Social Login Quickstart](/sso/social-login) on integrating this authentication method into your application using the Scalekit SDK. This guide provides detailed information on implementing Google Social Login, allowing you to quickly and efficiently enhance your appâ€™s authentication capabilities.
