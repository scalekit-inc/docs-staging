**Add a new LinkedIn connection**

Click the "+ Add Connection" button and select LinkedIn from the list of available options.


## Configure OAuth settings

The OAuth Configuration details page helps you set up the connection:

- Note the **Redirect URI** provided for your app. You'll use this URL to register with LinkedIn.
- **Client ID** and **Client Secret** are generated by LinkedIn when you register an OAuth App. They enable Scalekit
  to authenticate your app and establish trust with LinkedIn.

### Set up LinkedIn OAuth 2.0

LinkedIn lets you set up OAuth through the Mircosoft Identity Platform.
[Follow LinkedIn's instructions to set up OAuth 2.0](https://dub.sh/social-connection-linkedin).

- Use the Redirect URI from Scalekit as the Redirect URI in LinkedIn's setup
- Copy the generated Client ID and Client Secret into the Scalekit Dashboard

After completing the setup, click "Save Changes" in Scalekit for the changes to take effect.
