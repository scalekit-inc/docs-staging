## Configure OAuth settings

The OAuth Configuration details page helps you set up the connection:

- Note the **Redirect URI** provided for your app. You'll use this URL to register with Microsoft.
- **Client ID** and **Client Secret** are generated by Microsoft when you register an OAuth App. They enable Scalekit to
  authenticate your app and establish trust with Microsoft.

## Set up Microsoft OAuth 2.0

Microsoft lets you set up OAuth through the Mircosoft Identity Platform.
[Follow Microsoft's instructions to set up OAuth 2.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app).

- Use the Redirect URI from Scalekit as the
  [Redirect URI in Microsoft's setup](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app?tabs=certificate#add-a-redirect-uri)
- Copy the generated Client ID and Client Secret into the Scalekit Dashboard

After completing the setup, click "Save Changes" in Scalekit for the changes to take effect.

access. A summary table will show the information that will be sent to your app.
