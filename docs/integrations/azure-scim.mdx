# Microsoft Entra ID

<Subtitle>Sync user lists with apps during onboarding</Subtitle>

## Overview

This guide helps administrators sync their EntraID directory with an application they want to onboard to their organization. Integrating your application with Entra ID automates user management tasks and ensures access rights stay up-to-date.

This registration sets up the following:

1. **Endpoint**: This is the URL where EntraID sends requests to the onboarded app, acting as a communication point between them.
2. **Bearer Token**: Used by EntraID to authenticate its requests to the endpoint, ensuring security and authorization.

These components enable seamless synchronization between your application and the EntraID directory.

## Create an Endpoint and API Token

Open the <TermTip jargon="Admin Portal" /> from the app being onboarded. Select the "Directory Sync" tab to display a list of Directory Providers. Choose "Entra ID" as your Directory Provider. If the Admin Portal is not accessible from the app, request instructions from the app owner.

:::note

If the "Directory Sync" tab is not visible, the feature may not be enabled for your organization. Contact the app owner to enable it via the Scalekit Dashboard: Organizations > Your Organization > Enable Directory Sync.

:::

Click "Configure" after selecting "EntraID" to generate an Endpoint URL and Bearer token for your organization, allowing the app to listen to events and maintain synchronization.

## Adding a New Application in Entra ID

To send user-related updates to the app you want to onboard, create a new app in Microsoft Entra ID

Go to the Microsoft Azure portal and select "Microsoft Entra ID".

Set the Provisioning Mode to "Automatic".

In the Admin Credentials section, set:
- Tenant URL: _Endpoint_
- Secret Token: _Bearer Token generated previously_

Go to "Overview > Manage > Provisioning" and ensure "Provisioning Status" is toggled "On".

Entra ID is now set up to send events to Hero SaaS when users are added or removed.

## Testing User/Group Provisioning

In the Hero SaaS Application, go to "Provision on demand". Input a user name from your user list and click "Provision".

Once provisioned, the user should appear in the admin portal, showing how many users have access to the Hero SaaS app.

Provisioning or deprovisioning users can be done from "Manage > User and groups > Add user/group". Microsoft docs state it takes about 40 minutes to successfully send these events to the Hero SaaS App.
