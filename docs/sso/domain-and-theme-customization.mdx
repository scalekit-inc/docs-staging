Customizing the Admin Portal helps align the UI interface with your application's brand identity, ensuring a cohesive look and feel. This guide walks you through the steps to customize to suit your brand.

## Custom Domain

Scalekit sets up your environment using a unique endpoint URL that ends with the <SimpleCode>scalekit.com</SimpleCode> domain. However, you can customize this using CNAME configuration.

Example:

| Before                                                               | After                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <SimpleCode> https:<span></span>//b2b-app.scalekit.com </SimpleCode> | <SimpleCode> https:<span></span>//sso.b2b-app.com </SimpleCode> |

Users will see this web address in their browser when they visit the Admin Portal or sign in using Single Sign-On (SSO)

:::info

1. CNAME Configuration Limitation: CNAME configuration is only available for production environments.
2. SSL Certificate Automation: After successful CNAME configuration, the SSL certificate for the custom domain will be automatically set up.
3. Base URL: Ensure the new CNAME URL is used as the base URL after configuration.
