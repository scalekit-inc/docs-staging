# Implement Identity Provider (IdP) initiated SSO

IdP-initiated SSO allows users to log into your application directly from their identity provider's
portal. While convenient, it poses security risks such as stolen SAML assertions.

In IdP initiated SSO:

1. The user logs into their identity provider portal and selects your application.
2. The identity provider sends the user's details as assertions to your application.
3. Your application validates the assertions, retrieves the user information, and if everything
   checks out, logs the user in.

</figure>

Since the login is initiated from the identity provider's portal, this flow is called IdP-initiated
SSO.

## Security Risks

**Stolen SAML Assertions**: Attackers can steal these assertions and use them to gain unauthorized
access. If an attacker manages to steal these assertions, they can:

- Inject them into another service provider, gaining access to that user's account
- Inject them back into your application with altered assertions, potentially elevating their
  privileges

With a stolen SAML assertion, an attacker can gain access to your application as the compromised
user, bypassing the usual authentication process. This compromised behavior is much harder with
Service Provider (SP) initiated SSO flow.

### How Attackers Steal SAML Assertions

Attackers can steal SAML assertions through various methods:

- **Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) Attacks**: Intercepting and replacing the SAML response during
  transmission.
- **Open Redirect Attacks**: Exploiting improper endpoint validation to redirect the SAML response
  to a malicious server.
- **Leaky Logs and Headers**: Sensitive information, including SAML assertions, can be leaked
  through logs or headers.
- **Browser-Based Attacks**: Exploiting browser vulnerabilities to steal SAML assertions

### The Challenge for Service Providers

The chief problem with stolen assertions is that everything appears legitimate to the service
provider. The message and assertion are valid, issued by the expected identity provider, and signed
with the expected key. However, the service provider cannot verify whether the assertions are stolen
or not. This makes it difficult to detect and prevent unauthorized access through stolen SAML
assertions.

## Mitigating Security Risks: Convert IdP-initiated to SP-initiated SSO

Despite the security risks, IdP initiated SSO offers significant convenience to end users, allowing
them to easily log into various applications used within their organization. As such, it's important
for your application to support it. To support it securely, convert the incoming IdP-initiated
request to an SP-initiated SSO flow. Refer the below diagram for the recommended workflow from
Scalekit.

<figure>

  <figcaption>Scalekit's recommended workflow for IdP initiated SSO</figcaption>
</figure>

1. When Scalekit receives an IdP-initiated SSO request from a customer, it sends a request to your
   configured default
   <SimpleCode>redirect_uri</SimpleCode> (located in Scalekit Dashboard > API Config > Redirect URIs)
   with
   <SimpleCode>idp_initiated_login</SimpleCode> included as a request parameter.

<CodeWithHeader>

```xml
https://b2b-app.com/default-redirect-uri
  ?idp_initiated_login=<encoded_jwt_token>
```

</CodeWithHeader>

2. The <SimpleCode>idp_initiated_login</SimpleCode> request parameter is a signed JWT token
   containing all necessary details to identify the organization, SSO connection, and user
   information, enabling you to initiate a new authorization request.

<CodeWithHeader>

```js
{
  "organization_id": "org_225336910XXXX588",
  "connection_id": "conn_22533XXXXX575236",
  "login_hint": "name@example.com",
  "exp": 1723042087,
  "nbf": 1723041787,
  "iat": 1723041787,
  "iss": "https://b2b-app.com"
}
```

</CodeWithHeader>

3. You can use any of these three parameters to initiate a new SSO request. Since the user is
   already logged into their Identity Provider, they are not prompted to authenticate again,
   providing a seamless experience while addressing potential security vulnerabilities associated
   with IdP-initiated SSO.

In case of error, the redirect URI will receive a callback containing the error information as query
parameters.

<CodeWithHeader>

```xml
https://b2b-app.com/callback?error=<error_category>&error_description=<details>
```

</CodeWithHeader>

## Advantages

The advantages of using this approach are:

- **Enhanced Security**: Overcomes the security risks of handling IdP-initiated SSO
- **Seamless Experience**: The additional redirect is almost instantaneous, providing a smooth user
  experience

By following these steps, you can support IdP-initiated SSO while maintaining a high level of
security for your users
