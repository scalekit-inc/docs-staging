# Integrate with Firebase

<Subtitle>Enable SSO for Firebase apps with Scalekit OpenID Connect</Subtitle>

## Introduction

This guide streamlines the integration of Scalekit with Firebase applications, enabling seamless Single Sign-on (SSO)
authentication for your users. We'll walk you through configuring your Firebase project with Scalekit and provide sample
code to manage Scalekit SSO within your app's Firebase environment.

## Before You Begin

- Ensure access to Firebase Authentication with Identity Platform. OpenID Connect is not available in Legacy Firebase
  Authentication. See the [product comparison](https://cloud.google.com/identity-platform/docs/product-comparison) for
  details.
- Access to your [Scalekit account](https://app.scalekit.com)

## Set up Firebase

### Add Scalekit as an OpenID Connect Provider

1. Log in to the [Firebase Management Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and select your project.
2. Go to **Authentication** > **Sign-in method**.
3. Click **Add new provider** and select OpenID Connect.
4. Choose Code flow for the **Grant Type** and set the Name to "Scalekit".
5. Retrieve the Client ID, Issuer URL, and Client secret from your Scalekit API Config.

### Retrieve Configuration Details from Scalekit

1. Log in to your Scalekit Dashboard and navigate to **Settings** > **API Config**.
2. Locate the following fields in your Scalekit API Config:
   - Client ID
   - Environment URL
   - Client secret (generate a new one if needed)

  <figcaption>Copy credentials from your Scalekit Dashboard</figcaption>
</figure>

1. Copy the Client ID from Scalekit and paste it into the **Client ID** field in your Firebase project's OIDC provider
   settings.
2. Copy the Environment URL from Scalekit and paste it into the **Issuer URL** field in your Firebase project's OIDC
   provider settings.
3. Copy the newly generated Client secret from Scalekit and paste it into the **Client secret** field in your Firebase
   project's OIDC provider settings. After filling in these details, your Firebase project's OIDC provider settings
   should look similar to this:

### Add Redirect URI in Scalekit API Config

After defining new OIDC provider, you would need to Configure OIDC Integration in your Firebase project. Copy the
Callback URL from your Firebase project and add it as a new Redirect URI in your Scalekit API Config

<figure>
  ![Scalekit - Firebase Integration](@site/docs/sso/assets/integrations/firebase/4.png)
  <figcaption>In your Firebase project, copy the Callback URL under "Configure OIDC Integration"</figcaption>
</figure>

Add this URL as a new Redirect URI in your Scalekit API Config.

### Handle Identity Provider-Initiated Single Sign-On

In the current setup, Firebase acts as an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider for Scalekit. When a user signs in with
Firebase, their information is sent to Scalekit. Scalekit then redirects the user to authenticate with their identity
provider and sends the user information back to your app.

Users can access your app directly from their identity provider via Single Sign-On (SSO). To handle these SSO requests,
create a dedicated endpoint in your app. This endpoint will complete the authentication flow when users initiate SSO
from their identity provider. For detailed instructions on implementing the IdP-initiated SSO flow, refer to
[Implement IdP-Initiated SSO](docs/sso/guides/setup-sso/implement-idp-initiated-sso) guide. This guide walks you through
the necessary steps to set up and handle SSO requests originating from the identity provider.

## Enable Single Sign-on in Your Login Page

Modify your app's login page to invoke SSO and send the request to Scalekit with user details.

<CodeWithHeader title="Login.js">

```javascript title="Login.js" showLineNumbers

// Initialize Scalekit as OIDC provider
const scalekitProvider = new OAuthProvider('oidc.scalekit');

// Add custom parameters (organization_id, connection_id, or domain)
scalekitProvider.setCustomParameters({domain: 'email@yourcustomer.com'});

// When user clicks Login with SSO
loginbtn.onclick() {
  // Start sign-in and get user details
  signInWithPopup(auth, scalekitProvider)
    .then((result) => {
      // Get OAuth access token and ID token
      const credential = OAuthProvider.credentialFromResult(result);
      const user = result.user.providerData[0];
      // Access user details via user.email, user.displayName, etc.
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      // Handle errors
    });
}
```

</CodeWithHeader>

By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate Scalekit's Social Login into your Firebase application, employ
Single Sign-on authentication seamlessly.
