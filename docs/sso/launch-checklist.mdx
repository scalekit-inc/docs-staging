Switch from development to production credentials, including the Client ID, Client Secret, and Environment URL.

<LabeledCheckbox id="2"> **Secure the Client Secret** </LabeledCheckbox>

Your client secret is akin to a key to your application. Secure it with the utmost care. Go through our [best practices guide](/sso/guides/key-concepts/manage-client-secrets) to learn how to manage the client secrets safely and securely.

<LabeledCheckbox id="3"> **Verify Redirect URI Configuration** </LabeledCheckbox>

Double-check your Redirect URI settings in the production environment to ensure they point to the correct endpoints. For guidelines on valid configurations, visit our [Redirect URI configuration guide](/sso/guides/key-concepts/redirect-uri).

<LabeledCheckbox id="4"> **Test the Single Sign on flows** </LabeledCheckbox>

Ensure that you have implemented and tested all possible Single Sign-on workflows between your application and your customer's Identity providers. Go through our [how-to guide](/sso/test-sso) to understand all the SSO scenarios and how to validate them for production readiness.

For a consistent and professional user experience, confirm your branding (logos, accent colors, etc) is applied to the admin portal.

<LabeledCheckbox id="6"> **Review Admin Portal URL** </LabeledCheckbox>

Customize the admin portal URL to match your domain (for example, <SimpleCode>https:<span></span>//sso.b2b-app.com </SimpleCode>) for a seamless brand experience. Also, Remember to update <SimpleCode>.env</SimpleCode> file post-CNAME configuration.
