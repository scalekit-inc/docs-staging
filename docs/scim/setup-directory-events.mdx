# Setup Directory Events

<Subtitle>Experimenting with Event Handling using the Webhook Endpoints</Subtitle>

To listen to events from directory providers, register a Webhook endpoint in the Scalekit dashboard.
Scalekit sends payloads to the registered endpoint as events occur. B2B applications can use the
information in these payloads to:

- **Create** a user account in your app
- **Remove** or **deactivate** a user account in your app
- **Update** user's information
- **Assign** a role to the user

## Setting Up Your Webhook

Open the Scalekit dashboard and navigate to **Webhooks** on the left sidebar.

</figure>

Select **Add Endpoint** to proceed to the endpoint setup screen.

- **Endpoint URL**: This is the URL you create in your app to listen to events from Scalekit.
- **Event Subscription**: Subscribe to the events you want to receive from the event catalog. For
  directory events, select all options under the directory category.
- Click **Create** to set up the Webhook.

The Webhook is now successfully set up. Refer to the **Events Documentation** to understand the
properties your app receives in the event payload for each event.

### Play with Test Webhook Endpoints

If you haven't started building a Webhook endpoint yet and are still exploring, Scalekit offers a
convenient way to set up an endpoint for testing. Simply click on **"With Svix Play,"** and the
input field will automatically populate with a test endpoint. This endpoint receives the same
information as any endpoint in your B2B app, allowing you to proceed with testing seamlessly.

## Testing Your Webhook

To test how your app handles events, you can manually trigger an example payload from Scalekit.
Access the list of registered endpoints by navigating to **Webhooks > Endpoints Tab**. Select the
event you want to trigger and send an example payload.

Next, go to the **Testing Tab** to explore options for testing your integration. Choose an event
from the available list. For instance, select <SimpleCode>scalekit.dir.user.create</SimpleCode> to
view the JSON payload that will be sent as a test.

</figure>

Click **"Send Example"** to trigger the registered endpoint with the payload. Verify the payload to
ensure the simulation is successful, and then proceed to build the features based on this test.

## Next Steps

With your B2B app now set up to listen to directory events, consider how to utilize the payloads to
fulfill the business logic of your application(s) effectively.
