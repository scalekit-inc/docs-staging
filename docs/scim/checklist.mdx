# Launch Checklist

<Subtitle>
  Ensure these steps are completed before moving automated user provisioning to production
</Subtitle>

As you prepare to deploy SCIM Provisioning, verify that all configurations are optimized for
security and user experience. The following checklist helps ensure your implementation is
production-ready and efficient.

<LabeledCheckbox id="1"> Use appropriate environment variables </LabeledCheckbox>

Switch from development to production credentials, including the Client ID, Client Secret, and
Environment URL.

<LabeledCheckbox id="2"> Secure the Client Secret </LabeledCheckbox>

Your client secret is akin to a key to your application. Secure it with the utmost care. Go through
our [best practices guide](/sso/guides/key-concepts/manage-client-secrets) to learn how to manage
the client secrets safely and securely.

<LabeledCheckbox id="3"> Configure Webhooks </LabeledCheckbox>

Setup webhooks for receiving real-time updates on user and group changes. Follow our
[webhook security guide](/scim/webhooks) to learn how to secure your webhooks.

<LabeledCheckbox id="4"> Test Provisioning Flows </LabeledCheckbox>

Ensure that you have implemented and tested all possible SCIM provisioning workflows such as:

- User Provisioning
- User De-provisioning
- User Profile Update
- Group Membership Changes
- Role Assignments

<LabeledCheckbox id="5"> Finalize Branding & Theming </LabeledCheckbox>

For a consistent user experience, ensure your branding (logo, colors) are added to the Admin Portal

<LabeledCheckbox id="6"> Review Admin Portal URL </LabeledCheckbox>

Customize the admin portal URL to match your domain (for
example,<SimpleCode>https:<span></span>//admin.hero-saas.app</SimpleCode>) for a seamless brand
experience. Also, Remember to update <SimpleCode>.env</SimpleCode> file post CNAME configuration.
Read [customizing the admin portal](/scim/domain-and-theme-customization) on how to match your
brand.

<LabeledCheckbox id="7"> Graceful Error Handling </LabeledCheckbox>

Test thoroughly across all possible edge cases, including incomplete, invalid, or duplicate data.
