# Automatic Role Assignment

<Subtitle>
  Assing roles to users (in your app) based on their group memberships in their directory.
</Subtitle>

Manually assigning roles to users in your app (e.g., viewer, member, editor, admin) can be
time-consuming for administrators, especially in large enterprises where access requirements change
frequently. Scalekit allows administrators to set up workflows that automatically inform your app
about the roles to assign to users.

## Introduction

A popular approach for automating role assignment is to create groups in the directory provider.
Each group lists the users that should have a specific role in your app. For example, an
administrator might create a "GitHub Maintainers" group to grant "maintainer" access to the GitHub
app for certain employees.

By leveraging Scalekit's events, your app can be informed about these groups and their members,
enabling you to automatically assign the appropriate roles to users.

## Enabling Group-Based Role Assignment

To enable administrators to map groups to roles in your app:

1. Go to the Scalekit Dashboard
2. Select Configuration > "Roles"
3. Toggle "Group Based Role Assignment"
4. Create your app's roles

</figure>

The first role you create in your app becomes the default role automatically. This means users who
don't belong to any specific group will be assigned this role upon account creation. To change the
default role, navigate to the role settings, click the "..." menu next to the desired role, select
"Edit," and toggle the "Set as default role" option.

Choose clear Display Names and Descriptions for your roles to help administrators understand the
access levels in the Admin Portal.

## Creating Webhook Endpoint

To assign roles based on group membership, your app needs to be informed about groups and their
users. Here's an example webhook endpoint using Next.js:

<CodeWithHeader title="Webhook Endpoint">

<Tabs groupId="tech-stack" queryString>
<TabItem value="nextjs" label="Next.js">

```javascript showLineNumbers
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';

/**
 * Webhook Endpoint: /api/webhook/role-assignment
 * app/api
 * └── webhook
 *     └── role-assignment
 *         └── route.ts
 */

export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const event = await req.json();
  const { email, name } = event.data;
  await assignRole(roleName, email);
  return NextResponse.json({ message: "Role assigned" }, { status: 201 });
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</CodeWithHeader>

Register this webhook in the Scalekit Dashboard > Webhooks and subscribe to all group-related
events. In this example,

<SimpleCode>
  https:<span></span>//www<span></span>.hero-saas.app<span></span>/api/webhook/role-assignment
</SimpleCode>
is the webhook endpoint.

## Example Event Object

When an administrator creates a group or adds users to a group, Scalekit sends an event object to
your app with the necessary information to assign roles.

<CodeWithHeader title="Group Creation Event">

<JsonViewer
  src={{
    data: {
      directory_id: 'dir_38610496391217780',
      display_name: 'Avengers',
      external_id: null,
      id: 'dirgroup_38862741498233423',
      organization_id: 'org_38609339635728478',
      raw_attributes: {
        displayName: 'Avengers',
        members: null,
      },
    },
    environment_id: 'env_32080745237316098',
    id: 'evt_38862741515010639',
    object: 'DirectoryGroup',
    occurred_at: '2024-09-25T02:26:39.036398577Z',
    organization_id: 'org_38609339635728478',
    spec_version: '1',
    type: 'scalekit.dir.group.create',
  }}
/>

</CodeWithHeader>

<CodeWithHeader title="User Addition to Group Event">

<JsonViewer
  src={{
    data: {
      directory_id: 'dir_38610496391217780',
      display_name: 'Avengers',
      external_id: null,
      id: 'dirgroup_38862741498233423',
      organization_id: 'org_38609339635728478',
      raw_attributes: {
        displayName: 'Avengers',
        members: [
          {
            display: 'testuser2@gmail.com',
            value: 'diruser_38864946578129487',
          },
        ],
      },
    },
    environment_id: 'env_32080745237316098',
    id: 'evt_38864948910162368',
    object: 'DirectoryGroup',
    occurred_at: '2024-09-25T02:48:34.745030921Z',
    organization_id: 'org_38609339635728478',
    spec_version: '1',
    type: 'scalekit.dir.group.update',
  }}
/>

</CodeWithHeader>

The event data is contained within the data property, while other information about the organization
and event type is present at the same level as data in the JSON object.

Group-based role assignment offers several benefits:

- Easy setup for your customers
- Flexible role mapping
- No need for workarounds
- Automatic, realtime role assignment based on events from directory provider

By leveraging Scalekit's group-based role assignment, you can streamline access management for your
enterprise customers and ensure that user roles stay up-to-date with their directory provider. For
more information about event objects, refer to the
[Events Reference documentation](/apis#tag/Webhooks).
