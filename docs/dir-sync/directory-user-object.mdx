# Directory User Object

<Subtitle>Discover the Directory User Attributes from the Directory Providers</Subtitle>

Organizations rely on Directory Providers as the source of truth for user information. By setting up Directory Sync,
your app receives real-time updates, ensuring it remains current with this source. Scalekit normalizes data from
Directory Providers that adhere to the SCIM protocol.

:::note

If your directory, such as Google Workspace, does not follow the SCIM protocol, please contact us at hi@scalekit.com for
guidance on the next steps.

:::

Your app can [register a Webhook endpoint](https://www.example.org) to listen to these directory events. See the
[Events Reference](https://www.example.org) for more information. Each Event Object has a Directory User Object as part
of its payload.

## Directory User Object Attributes

Each Directory User Object has the following attributes:

## Custom Attributes

Custom attributes are admin-defined data points or properties that your app can use to tailor and enhance user
experiences. These attributes allow for the personalization of content, features, and functionalities based on specific
user characteristics or preferences. For example, if your B2B SaaS app offers analytics dashboards, you can use a custom
attribute like <SimpleCode>department</SimpleCode> to display relevant dashboards to users.

[Learn more about mapping the necessary attributes from the directory provider](https://www.example.org).

## Raw Attributes

Scalekit receives information via the SCIM protocol and retains all properties from the directory provider under
the <SimpleCode>raw_attributes</SimpleCode> property without modification.
